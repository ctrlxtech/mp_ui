                        Weâ€™re very careful about the massage therapists we select to join the MassagePanda network. We interview and test all of our therapists in person and make sure they are fully licensed and insured in their state of practice. We accept only the highest quality therapists with a history of excellence in customer satisfaction. Most of our therapists have at least five years of practical experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In California, the process to become a certified massage therapist (CMT) requires applicants to take professional training for five hundred hours and to successfully pass background checks conducted by a state investigator, before being deemed able to safely work with the public. All MassagePanda massage therapists have passed these government sponsored certification measures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All our massage therapists have the highest level of integrity and professionalism. In return, we expect all clients to reciprocate the same level of respect and conduct.

                        Any of these modalities can be performed as a Couples Massage, which means that two MassagePanda therapists will perform massages for you and your spouse/partner/friend at the same time. Please indicate Couples Massage in the special instruction section during your booking.

                        Once an appointment is confirmed, you are notified via e-mail and text. We understand that plans can change, so if you need to cancel your appointment, you can do so within 10 minutes of confirmation with no penalty. After the initial 10 minute period, unfortunately, we have to charge a $50 penalty for any cancellation that takes place less than 4 hours prior to the scheduled massage time. For massages that are cancelled less than 1 hour from the scheduled appointment time, we charge the full amount of the massage. We put these cancellation policies in place to protect our therapists, as they lose income when cancellations occur, and need to receive compensation for time they have set aside.

                        It doesn't matter at all what you wear. During the session, your preference for your state of undress depends on your comfort level. However, it will feel best for the client to be completely unclothed, for the creams and oils to fully glide on the skin, and the session to flow like a dance. There will be draping to always protect the modesty of the client.
